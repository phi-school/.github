# Code of Conduct

The primary goal of phi school is to foster a learning environment that cultivates and supports human flourishing.

Our code of conduct can be encapsulated by a simple motto:

> "Be human to each other."

In this context, _human_ signifies being humble, compassionate, kindhearted, considerate, understanding, sympathetic, empathetic, tolerant, and accessible.

We strive to alleviate each other's burdens, not to exacerbate them.

We aim for equilibrium, shunning hierarchy and exclusivity.

In debates, we engage in good faith, treating each other's positions with respect and admiration. Our goal is to uncover truth, not to foster competition or dominance.

We reject divisive thinking and instead seek to transcend superficial boundaries.

We believe that adherence to this conduct will guide us towards what can truly be regarded as _good_.
