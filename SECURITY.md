## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Please do **NOT** open an issue on GitHub to report the security vulnerability.

Instead, please [privately report a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) with the following information:

- A brief description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Your contact information for further communication

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and will send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

Please note that we may not be able to provide an estimated time frame for the resolution of the issue. We will keep you updated on the progress towards the resolution. Once the issue has been resolved, we may coordinate an announcement with you.

Thank you for helping keep our users safe!
